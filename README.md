# ITA PhD course

*Computational research with COMPAS*

## Description

The PhD-level course (primarily for A&T PhDs) will introduce computational methods for architecture engineering, fabrication & construction, incentivising computational literacy. Students learn the theoretical background and basic implementation details of fundamental data structures and algorithms, and to solve real-world problems using the COMPAS framework and other open-source libraries.

## Learning objectives

* understand the scope and relevance of computational methods for architecture and engineering research and practice,
* the theoretical background of fundamental data structures, 
* the basic principles of algorithmic design; 
* implement basic versions of prevalent algorithms related to architectural geometry, structural design, robotic assembly, volumetric modeling & 3D-printing, high-performance computation; 
* use sophisticated algorithms available through open-source libraries to solve real-world problems; and, 
* use common CAD tools as interfaces to self-implemented solutions.

## Overview

Course will consist of a few lectures, several tutorials and project-based exercises.

Topics will include:

* Intro Python programming
* Intro COMPAS open-source framework (https://compas-dev.github.io/) 
* Intro to geometry processing, data structures, topology, numerical computation
* Domain-specific case studies (e.g. on architectural geometry, structural design, robotic assembly, volumetric modeling and 3D printing, high performance computation)

## Jupyter and extensions

If you have Anaconda installed, then jupyter is already installed. If not, then install jupyter with pip.

To run the jupyter notebook, you simply have to type:

    jupyter notebook

in your command line.

### Configure workspace

To configure the workspace, type

    jupyter notebook --generate-config

This writes a default configuration file into:

`%HOMEPATH%\.jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config.py` (on windows)

or

`~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` (on mac)

If you want jupyter to open in a different directory, then change the following line:

    c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = 'YOUR_PREFERRED_PATH'

### Download nbextensions

To install nbextensions, execute the commands below in Anaconda Prompt:

    conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_nbextensions_configurator

After installing, restart the Jupyter notebook, and you can observe a new tab Nbextensions added to the menu.
Install the following extensions:

1. Split Cells Notebook - Enable split cells in Jupyter notebooks

2. RISE - allows you to instantly turn your Jupyter Notebooks into a slideshow.
