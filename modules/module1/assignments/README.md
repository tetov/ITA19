## Module 1.1

### Update selfweight

1. Apply selfweight as load
    * Compute selfweight per node (tributary area)
    * Apply selfweight (attribute ‘pz’)
    * Compute equilibrium
    * Visualize residual forces (attributes ‘rx’, ‘ry’, ‘rz’)
2. Find shape in equilibrium with selfweight
    * Recompute equilibrium for new selfweight
    * Recompute selfweight
    * Repeat until convergence
### Update force density of cables

1. Select cable
    * Select edge
    * Find rest of cable

2. Update force density of all edges in cable

3. Update equilibrium
